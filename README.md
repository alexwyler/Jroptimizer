# Jroptimizer

## Environment Variables
```
 BATTLE_NET_ID = <battle.net api client id>
 BATTLE_NET_SECRET = <battle.net api client secret>
 RAIDBOTS_EMAIL = <raidbots.com username/email>
 RAIDBOTS_PASSWORD = <raidbots.com password>
```

Note: the battle.net keys are required, but the Raidbots authentication will only add benefit if you are on an upgraded account.

## Running
```
gulp run
```
This will build and run the app, producing a large amount of debugging output and then eventually a Google Sheets URL of the new or updated spreadsheet containing Battle for Dazar'Alor upgrades.
